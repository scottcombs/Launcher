# Launcher
Launcher is a menubar app that allows global hotkeys to launch files or applications. It can be set up to run a bootup, nearly no restrictions on how many items (although the list may run off your screen), and stores its items automatically when the application quits. Easy to use, has help, and is a good example how to make a NSStatusBar item on the system statusbar.
